# Getting started: meet the kernel, then make one useful change

Install OpenRig, use a working provider login, and meet the kernel operator with
the advisor and TUI beside it. No starter team is needed to reach that view.
Tell the operator what you want to do, then choose a project team for a bounded
change you can exercise. Reuse the accounts and terminal tools you already have.

You need Node.js 22 or 24 and tmux, on macOS or Linux. On Linux, the
distribution's own Node.js can be older (Ubuntu 24.04's is 18); install a
supported version with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (`nvm install 22`)
or NodeSource. On a Mac with Apple
silicon, use Node.js 22 (see the [compatibility
history](../releases/v0.5.15.md#known-compatibility-limitation)). Native
Windows is not supported yet, and WSL2 has not been tested. Node 20 and
odd-numbered releases (23, 25 and so on) are not supported; Node 26 and later
even-numbered releases are untested.

**Choose permissions before starting the team.** Ordinary OpenRig launches use
Codex's `-s workspace-write`, with approval policy from your native configuration,
or Claude Code's `acceptEdits`, which still leaves commands subject to native
rules and prompts (the kernel's own seats get a wider operational default). Codex's
sandbox normally blocks network access, including the local OpenRig daemon, so
before that plain launch OpenRig asks Codex for its own configuration and adds
network access inside the sandbox only when Codex answers that no configuration
layer sets `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access` and no managed requirement
could restrict it; if Codex can't be asked or doesn't answer in time, the launch
is left unchanged. To keep it off, set `network_access = false` under
`[sandbox_workspace_write]` in your Codex configuration. If Codex does not answer
within a few seconds, the seat starts without it. A command allowance does not
change general sandbox/network settings. The starter's `profile: default` selects OpenRig resources, not a native
permission profile.
Agent-guided setup [asks once](#have-your-agent-configure-permissions): “Allow
your agents to run OpenRig commands without repeated permission prompts?”
**Yes — recommended** / **No — keep prompts**. An existing explicit choice is
reused; No or no answer leaves settings unchanged. Broader access is separate.

## Install and sign in

### Choose your providers

Ask: **“Which working account do you want this team to use: Claude Code, Codex,
or both?”** Reuse an explicit choice already made. Recommend the account the
user already has working; a second subscription is not a prerequisite.

Install OpenRig (`npm install -g @openrig/cli`) and check `tmux -V`. With npm 11 or later, an `npm warn install-scripts` line for `@openrig/cli` is expected: only the postinstall Node.js and SQLite check was skipped, and `node "$(npm root -g)/@openrig/cli/scripts/check-abi.mjs"` runs it. Check **only the selected providers**:

- Claude Code: `claude --version` and `claude auth status`. If sign-in is missing,
  ask once: “Please run `claude auth login` in your launch environment.”
- Codex: `codex --version` and `codex login status`. If sign-in is missing,
  ask once: “Please run `codex login` in your launch environment.”

Install a missing selected CLI using its provider's installation instructions.
The other provider's CLI/login and Herdr/cmux are optional. Do not copy credentials
or start repeated sign-in attempts. Recheck the selected login after the user
completes it. `rig setup --dry-run` previews the broader setup; applying
`rig setup` installs/checks **both** harnesses and, on macOS, Homebrew and cmux
(off macOS those steps are skipped, and tmux isn't installed for you). It also
writes an OpenRig-managed block (mouse on, a longer history) into `~/.tmux.conf`.
It is optional for this selected-provider path, not a requirement to fix an unused
provider.

## Start the kernel and check its state

With a working selected login, start the daemon if it is stopped, then read its
state and the kernel seats:

```sh
rig daemon start  # only if the daemon is stopped
rig status
rig ps --nodes --rig kernel
```

Starting the kernel, including its operator and advisor, is part of installing
OpenRig. Keep it for a normal install: it helps you choose and start your project
team. `rig daemon start --no-kernel` is for automation or an explicit request to
omit the kernel; it leaves you without that operator.

On a fresh instance, explicit daemon startup chooses the kernel variant from
successful native auth probes: Claude alone, Codex alone, or both. It starts the
kernel in the background without a project starter. An absent unused provider is
fine; if both accounts are authenticated, the kernel uses both even when your
later project uses just one. A request to use only one provider for everything
is a separate choice.

**Started is not ready.** Read the `Kernel:` boot state in `rig status` and the
individual seat state in `rig ps --nodes --rig kernel`. The view may open while
agents finish starting; describe that state, without claiming they are ready.
A missing or unknown readiness signal is not proof of readiness. Follow
[Incomplete setup and restart](#incomplete-setup-and-restart) for login, trust,
startup or missing-seat problems.

`rig setup` itself does not start the daemon. Preserve a daemon and kernel that
already exist: ordinary daemon startup skips a managed kernel, and
`OPENRIG_NO_KERNEL=1` skips automatic kernel startup. If neither runtime is
authenticated, kernel boot reports `auth_blocked`. Do not restart or recreate an
existing kernel merely to open its view. The startup TUI (`rig`) offers its own
kernel setup and individual-seat recovery; it does not automatically boot agents
when it starts the daemon.

## Open the kernel conversations

The installing agent asks: **“Open the OpenRig view now?”**

- **Yes:** open a new space with the installed tools below. Keep the terminal in
  use and existing windows intact, including an agent's installation session.
- **No:** give the matching command so the person can open it later. Leave the
  current terminal alone.
- **Over SSH or without a local display:** give the exact connection/attach
  command for the installation host instead of trying to open a window here.

No, SSH and headless use are valid background outcomes, not setup failures.

Use **herdr first if installed**, **cmux second**, and otherwise give the exact
[new-terminal commands below](#plain-terminal-a-new-viewing-session).
To reach just the operator, use the [direct conversation command](#talk-to-the-operator-in-any-terminal).
`rig tui --shared` is the team dashboard, not the operator's conversation.
No new terminal-provider installation is needed for this offer. The first view
contains TUI | advisor | operator in that order, for Claude-only, Codex-only and
mixed kernels.
The queue worker stays out of this view; it remains reachable through the TUI.
This selects what you see, not which kernel seats run. Keep the current kernel,
accounts and conversations; opening a view is not a reason to start or restore
seats. If the kernel is starting, report that; opening the view need not wait.
If it is absent or blocked, follow
[Incomplete setup and restart](#incomplete-setup-and-restart).

### Confirm the existing seats

Run these on the daemon's machine, in the installation environment:

```sh
rig status
rig ps --nodes --rig kernel --json --fields logicalId,runtime,canonicalSessionName,tmuxAttachCommand
rig terminal status --json
```

Use the returned bindings, not the library preview. Find the rows whose
`logicalId` is `advisor.lead`, `operator.agent` and `operator.human` (the TUI).
For each, take its `canonicalSessionName`; a logical ID is not a tmux session
name. The default provider view resolves these values itself; use them directly for
the plain-terminal commands below. Missing bindings stay named missing; the
three-role view is the same regardless of the agents' runtimes.

### Herdr or cmux: one new workspace

OpenRig supplies `saved:kernel` automatically from the installed kernel's current
bindings: TUI | advisor | operator for every kernel. No YAML edit or daemon
restart is needed. It excludes
the queue worker and uses the existing conversations. Unavailable expected roles
are named in `absent`; with no attachable members, the result lists the missing
bindings. The runtime label describes the agents' runtime mix, or says that it is
unverified. Every default kernel view keeps the same three roles.

If you already saved a view with id `kernel` in `terminal-views.yaml`, your view
wins unchanged. Other saved views are preserved. Check the listed membership
before opening a custom view.

Check `rig terminal status --json` for provider availability and liveness. If
herdr is installed but closed, open the app normally and check again. When it
is available:

```sh
rig terminal views --json
rig terminal open saved:kernel --provider herdr --json
```

If herdr is unavailable, use a running cmux:

```sh
rig terminal open saved:kernel --provider cmux --json
```

These view opens create a fresh provider workspace. Inspect `opened`, `absent`,
`degraded` and any notes, then confirm the new workspace actually shows the
intended conversations and TUI. A partial result is not a complete handoff.
For herdr, open or attach the actual herdr session in the new space and check
what the person sees. A created workspace is not proof of a visible window;
running the CLI in a new OS terminal window does not show that workspace there.
Do not use `rig terminal open kernel` for this first view: it also includes the
queue worker. A failed or uncertain open is not evidence that nothing opened;
inspect the provider before retrying or falling back. If the shared TUI tile
shows a shell, run `rig tui` **in that new tile**, not in the installing agent's
terminal.

### Talk to the operator in any terminal

No herdr or cmux is needed. On the kernel's host, run:

```sh
rig ps --nodes --rig kernel --json
```

Find the row whose `logicalId` is `operator.agent`. Replace the placeholder below
with that row's `canonicalSessionName`, then run this in a **new terminal on the
same host, as the same user**:

```sh
env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t '=<canonicalSessionName>'
```

This shows the operator's existing conversation and lets you type your answer.
The installing agent gives the person the command with the name already filled
in; it does not attach in its own terminal. Over SSH, connect to the installation
host first. Use **Ctrl-b, then d** to leave the conversation running and detach.
If the operator has no binding or needs attention, use
[Incomplete setup and restart](#incomplete-setup-and-restart).

### Plain terminal: a new viewing session

After Yes, if neither provider is available, compose existing tmux attachments. These
commands create only a new viewing session; they do not move or recreate the
kernel's panes. Run them once on the kernel host after checking the bindings
above. For a manual install, these prompts collect the three exact session names
from that inventory. An installing agent sets the same variables from the
observed values itself:

```sh
printf 'canonicalSessionName for operator.human (TUI): '; read -r tui_session
printf 'canonicalSessionName for advisor.lead: '; read -r advisor_session
printf 'canonicalSessionName for operator.agent: '; read -r operator_session
kernel_view="openrig-kernel-$(date +%s)-$$"
kernel_pane=$(tmux new-session -d -P -F '#{pane_id}' -s "$kernel_view" -n kernel "env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t '=$tui_session'")
advisor_pane=$(tmux split-window -h -P -F '#{pane_id}' -t "$kernel_pane" "env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t '=$advisor_session'")
tmux split-window -h -t "$advisor_pane" "env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t '=$operator_session'"
```

Then arrange the view and print its exact attach command:

```sh
tmux select-layout -t "$kernel_view:" even-horizontal
printf "env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t '=%s'\n" "$kernel_view"
```

**On macOS**, the installer can open a new Terminal window with that view:

```sh
osascript - "$kernel_view" <<'APPLESCRIPT'
on run argv
  tell application "Terminal"
    do script "env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t " & quoted form of ("=" & item 1 of argv)
    activate
  end tell
end run
APPLESCRIPT
```

**On a Linux desktop with GNOME Terminal**, use its explicit new-window action:

```sh
gnome-terminal --window -- env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t "=$kernel_view"
```

For another terminal app, use its **New Window** action and run the attach
command printed above in that window. After Yes, the installing agent should
perform the available new-window action.
If desktop automation is unavailable or denied, say so and give the printed
command to the person for a new terminal. Never silently reuse an existing
window. Close the viewing window or use **Ctrl-b, then d** to detach; don't
quit the native agents. A standalone `rig tui` in another new terminal is also
available if the shared TUI binding is missing, with that limitation stated.

### Headless or SSH handoff

A provider running on the server does not establish a window on your desktop.
When there is no display, say **“No visible terminal was opened here.”** Keep
the exact attach command printed above. From a new terminal on your own
machine, connect to the same host/account used for installation, then run that
command. For example, this asks for the actual SSH destination and the viewing
session name printed above; neither value is guessed:

```sh
printf 'Existing SSH destination (user@host): '; read -r kernel_host
printf 'Viewing session name (openrig-kernel-... printed above): '; read -r kernel_view
ssh -t "$kernel_host" "env -u TMUX tmux attach-session -t '=$kernel_view'"
```

The installing agent gives you the **fully resolved** connection and attach
command from the known installation host and created viewing session. If only
an HTTP daemon address is known, ask for the SSH connection details instead of
inventing them. No new account or credential provisioning is part of this
handoff. Report which provider or fallback ran, which conversations and TUI
were visible, and any headless or unverified branch.

### Installing-agent handoff

Ask what the person wants to do and which project folder to use. Hand that goal
to the ready kernel operator; do not implement the person's project yourself.
Find the `operator.agent` row with `rig ps --nodes --rig kernel --json` and take
its `canonicalSessionName`. Use that returned session name, not the logical ID:

```sh
rig send <canonicalSessionName> 'This is the agent that installed OpenRig. The person will answer in your pane. Goal: <goal>. Project folder: <absolute path>.'
```

Alternatively, have the person type the goal and folder in the operator pane.
Show where the operator answers in the existing view or give the exact attach
command [above](#talk-to-the-operator-in-any-terminal), with the observed name
filled in. `rig tui --shared` opens the dashboard, not this conversation.
If the person gives the installing agent a goal later, forward the goal, folder
and constraints with `rig send`; leave implementation with the operator's team.
The operator helps the person choose and start a team, then hands the goal to its
lead. Leave the project work with that team.

Finish installation when the operator is ready and the person is talking to it;
daemon health alone is not completion. Use the existing
[recovery routes](#incomplete-setup-and-restart) if the operator needs attention.
If the person chooses to talk later, keep that choice, leave the exact connection
step, and say that the conversation handoff is still pending. SSH, headless use,
and declining a desktop view remain valid background outcomes.

## Choose your first team

Tell the kernel operator what you want to do. It asks about your goal, presents
three teams with one recommendation, and fits the team to the providers you have.
Review that choice before launching it.

| Team | Agents and runtimes | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `starter` | `dev-build` (Claude Code) and `dev-review` (Codex, pinned `gpt-6-astra`) | One bounded change |
| `workshop` | A lead, a builder, QA and a reviewer | Ongoing work in one repository. It's a rig bundle, not built in: the operator installs it from its pinned listing |
| `factory` | Seven: a lead, an advisor, build, QA, design and two independent reviewers | Sustained product work. It uses the most concurrent capacity |

As shipped, `starter` needs both Claude Code and Codex. With only one of them, the
operator writes an adapted copy of the team for your providers and keeps its name;
there are no per-provider variants. `first-project` is starter's old name and
still starts it, so an old `rig up first-project` now starts a Claude builder and a
Codex reviewer.

Claude seats use the native default model, as the Claude kernel does: OpenRig
does not pass a model override. Read the selected harness's configured model and
show it alongside the team and launch command before proceeding. Confirm account access to any pin; if unavailable,
ask for a supported model choice rather than silently substituting a model or
provider. After launch, confirm the actual native model before assigning work.

### Launch the starter team

```sh
cd <your-repository>
rig specs preview starter --kind rig
rig up starter --cwd . --plan
rig up starter --cwd .
rig status
rig ps --nodes --rig starter
```

Preview the selected seats, models and resources. Plan checks resolution and
preflight for the working directory. The kernel is already your entry point; this step starts the chosen project
team. Read readiness for the project seats, not only daemon health. Resolve a named authentication, trust or permission prompt before giving
that seat work. When a seat stops at such a prompt, `rig up` reports
`Status: partial`, prints `Startup attention (<seat>): <reason>` and exits 1;
`rig ps --nodes` repeats it as "Startup details". The reason ends with the command
to run once the prompt is answered: `rig seat continue <seat>`, which delivers the
seat's startup context in the same conversation. No new team is needed when
returning to an existing project.

When a seat pauses, open its existing terminal with **o** in the startup view.
Read the proposed command, working directory and target instance. For an intended
local `rig` call, choose the native prompt's one-time approval if that is the scope
you want; a saved command-prefix allowance also affects future matching calls.
Decline an unexpected operation and tell the same agent what to do instead.
Approval controls whether an action may run; the sandbox controls its filesystem
and network access. Turning approvals off does not grant network access.

After answering, watch for the command's result and the agent continuing. Read
the corresponding queue row and transition from your ordinary terminal. If an
operation timed out, read its result before asking for another attempt: it may
already have taken effect. A delivered message or disappearing prompt alone is
not progress. If startup is still waiting for context delivery, use **c** (or
`rig seat continue <seat>`) for the same occupant, then **r** to refresh. If the
command times out, check `rig seat status <seat>` before trying again. Do not
start another seat to clear a prompt.

Starter is a deliberately small starting point. For a bigger team, `factory` is
built in (seven agents, using more concurrent capacity), and so are the specialist
teams `code-review`, `research` and `pm`. Inspect `rig specs ls --kind rig` and
`rig specs preview <name>` before selecting one. A team published on GitHub, such
as workshop, installs from its folder link with `rig up <link>` (see
[publishing a rig bundle](publishing-a-rig-bundle.md)).

## Give the builder an outcome

For example, in a project that imports CSV files:

```sh
rig send dev-build@starter 'Improve the CSV import error when a required column is missing: name the column and leave the existing data unchanged. Add a regression check, ask dev-review for an independent check of the exact candidate, and record the result and how I can try it. Keep the change local; do not publish.'
```

Replace the example with a real problem in your repository. Include what the
user should observe, a boundary and how success can be checked. The builder
creates and claims a durable task, implements it, and routes the selected
independent check. You should not have to relay the review between terminals.
`rig send` is the initial conversation; the queue and repository artifacts
retain the work. An unbound shell does not need to impersonate a queue owner.

Seat addresses carry the rig name (for example, `dev-build@starter`). From an
actual project seat, follow the work with
`rig queue list --limit 1000`: its default scope is the caller's current rig.
`queue list` has no `--rig` option. From an observer shell or another rig, use
`rig queue list --destination dev-build@starter --limit 1000` and the same
command for `dev-review@starter`, after verifying those live addresses.
These show each destination's obligations, not a whole-rig view. An unbound shell
must not pretend to be a seat to change scope; use `--all-rigs` only when that
broader view is intended. Then read `rig queue show <id> --full` and
`rig queue transitions <id>`. A delivered message is not a reviewed result.
Read the artifact, exercise its behavior, and check the candidate reviewed.

## Share the dashboard and return to it

```sh
rig tui --shared
```

A fresh kernel runs the ordinary TUI in its existing `operator-human` terminal.
This command attaches another client to that terminal. **Ctrl-b, then d**
detaches without quitting the TUI; return with the same command and the view
stays where it was. Another authorized agent can capture or operate that same
pane. It should tell you before changing your view. The terminal is not a
human inbox and does not prove anyone is watching it.

Plain `rig tui` remains an independent local view. If an older kernel or a TUI
you quit shows a shell, run `rig tui` in that shell once. `--shared` does not
start or replace a terminal, so a missing binding is reported with recovery
guidance rather than creating a second kernel.

Herdr users follow the same launch and task path. To place the managed team in
Herdr, use `rig terminal open starter --provider herdr`; for the shared
dashboard together with the kernel conversations, use the
[saved first view](#open-the-kernel-conversations). The equivalent
cmux provider is also available. Read the opened/absent/degraded result: a
partial terminal view is not a healthy team. Repeated terminal-open calls can
create another provider workspace; return to the one already open when you
want to preserve it. This is terminal integration, not native plugin enrollment.

## Continue real project work

Return to the same owner with the next outcome, citing the earlier result.
The seat address and durable queue survive closing your viewing terminal.
Keep intent, acceptance and evidence in the repository's existing project,
mission and slice artifacts; the starter reads those before inventing a path.
`rig context work-install` lists what the project declares (intent, context files,
skills). Without `--project` it picks the project by the seat's rig, then by the
working directory, and stops with `project_required` and the exact `--project`
commands only if several still match.

If the project has no work tree, start with `rig workspace doctor` and
`rig scope mission create --help`, then `rig scope slice create --help`. Set
the actual intended outcome before creating work. `rig scope` retains what is
being built. When repeated coordination warrants a workflow, discover with
`rig workflow specs`, inspect its owners and inputs, and instantiate the
selected name with `rig workflow instantiate --help`. A workflow is not needed
merely to make the first local change.

For a continuing team, [OpenRig Software Factory](../../packages/daemon/specs/agents/shared/skills/core/openrig-software-factory/SKILL.md)
offers manual/team work, queue-supported orchestration without Workflow, and an
optional explicit Workflow path, with wake defaults, token costs and permission
choices visible. Give its short request to your existing agent. After
installation, discover the compatible bundled recipe with `rig context show
skills/core/openrig-software-factory --json`; retain a missing/version-mismatch
result rather than silently using newer instructions. Its growth section keeps
three choices clear: stay with the pair, add one or two seats to the running rig
with `rig grow` and no YAML, or optionally author a custom rig. It covers
new-seat context/work ownership, concurrency costs and saving the expanded spec.
This guide remains the short first-use path.

## Incomplete setup and restart

| Observation | Next action |
| --- | --- |
| Tool missing or login fails | Use the specific setup/auth hint; recheck that executable in the launch shell. Do not send work to an unready seat. |
| "Startup attention" or "Startup details" names a prompt | Answer the login, trust or bypass prompt in that seat's terminal, then run the `rig seat continue <seat>` it shows. |
| "Readiness timeout after 30s — harness did not become interactive" | The harness took longer than the readiness window. Raise it for the next launch with `rig config set runtime.readiness_timeout_seconds <1-600>`, then relaunch that seat. |
| Daemon is healthy, kernel is still starting | Read `rig status` and `rig ps --nodes --rig kernel`; kernel readiness is separate. |
| Shared terminal is absent | Inspect the existing kernel binding and recovery state; use standalone `rig tui` while resolving it. |
| Viewing terminal was closed | Reattach with `rig tui --shared`; do not relaunch the team. |
| Daemon restarted but tmux survived | Re-read `rig status` and the existing queue; a daemon restart is not a fresh project. |
| Host reboot lost tmux sessions | Open `rig`, start the daemon if needed, and select the existing rig and seats. Resume is the default; a fresh conversation needs a separate decision. |
| Launch reports no usable snapshot | Inspect the existing rig and retained project files, then follow the same-seat recovery below. |
| Work is waiting on a prompt or decision | Read the row, transition and named prompt; preserve the obligation until the missing decision arrives. |

If a snapshot is unavailable, the startup view checks the selected seat's
retained startup source and authoritative occupant relation. It reports a
missing or ambiguous source instead of selecting an arbitrary historical row.
Repair the named source, retry, or leave the seat stopped. Check the retained
queue, project notes and observed result before continuing work.

`rig setup` prints the short form of this path once setup is ready; `rig status`
points back here while no rigs are registered.

### Use the startup and work TUI

Type `rig` in an ordinary terminal to open the startup and work TUI. It shows
the daemon address; **d** expands the selected instance path and diagnostics.
If the daemon is stopped, press Enter
to start that daemon, then choose the rigs and seats you want. Kernel is
recommended first; selecting its operator does not start every kernel seat.
The same view is available with **S** from ordinary TUI work.
**?** opens Help even while connection checks are pending. **w** skips startup;
**Esc** goes back, or leaves startup from its first page. These choices do not
start a daemon or a seat. **L** opens local reading before or after connecting:
choose configured Specs, project intent, projects, or missions and slices, then
select a directory or file. **r** reads the selected source again; **Esc** returns.
Local reading uses this machine's configured workspace paths and file allowlist,
including when the selected daemon address is remote. It shows disk provenance,
missing or denied sources, binary files and the 1 MiB text truncation boundary.
These disk snapshots may change after reading and do not supply live queue,
execution or topology state. Live views load after a confirmed connection and
deliberate entry; a stalled live read does not prevent Help or local reading.
When terminal transport is unavailable, **t** starts the empty terminal service
so recovery choices can be inspected. It launches no seats.

For a previously occupied seat, Enter attempts its previous conversation.
If history is unavailable, read the reason. **f** opens a separate fresh-start
decision for that named seat; **Esc** declines without launching it. A confirmed
fresh conversation receives the configured context and retains the old history,
but does not resume that history. Authentication or runtime failures require
repair of that prerequisite. **o** opens the existing native terminal here; detach
to return (tmux defaults to Ctrl-b, then d). Decide native trust/auth prompts
there. If a fresh start paused before context delivery, **c** finishes that
delivery to the same occupant (from a shell, `rig seat continue <seat>` does the
same). **r** reads actual state again; **d** expands details.

## Kernel framing (what `rig setup` does and does not do)

Explicit CLI daemon startup retains its automatic kernel behavior. The TUI
starts the daemon with kernel auto-boot disabled so the user can select seats:

- `rig setup` installs/verifies the runtime; it does not start the daemon or the
  kernel.
- Starting the daemon (`rig daemon start`, or implicitly via `rig up`) is what
  boots the kernel rig in the background.
- Starting it from bare `rig` prepares no agents automatically. The TUI offers
  kernel setup and individual seat selection after connecting.
- **Kernel readiness is a distinct signal from daemon health.** The daemon's HTTP
  health binds early; the kernel can still be booting or a kernel agent can be
  unhealthy while the daemon is up. `rig status` surfaces kernel readiness
  separately (via `/api/kernel/status`); `rig daemon start --wait-for-kernel`
  polls it.

## The scope <-> workflow bridge

Two related primitives, often confused by new operators:

- **`rig scope`** manages **durable, on-disk artifacts** - missions and slices
  (markdown/YAML files in your workspace). These are the persistent record of
  *what work exists*.
- **`rig workflow`** manages a **runtime instance** - when you
  `rig workflow instantiate <name>`, the daemon creates a workflow instance plus
  an **entry qitem** that routes the first step to an owner. This is the live
  coordination of *who does the next step*.

Scope files retain what the work is; workflow instances and their queue packets
retain who acts next. Creating or editing a mission does not start work. You can
instantiate a named workflow with `rig workflow instantiate <name> --root-objective <text> --created-by <session>` (both options are needed), or explicitly
inspect an authored lifecycle with `rig workflow compile` and create its runtime
with `rig workflow instantiate-lifecycle`. Compilation alone does not start work.
[OpenRig Software Factory](../../packages/daemon/specs/agents/shared/skills/core/openrig-software-factory/SKILL.md)
shows a small reviewed example and how to retain custody through a genuine wait.

## Have your agent configure permissions

Before team launch, your agent asks once, unless you already made an explicit
choice for these harnesses and this scope:

> Allow your agents to run OpenRig commands without repeated permission prompts?
> **Yes — recommended** / **No — keep prompts**

This covers the entire `rig` family, including starting/stopping agents,
configuration and launching processes. It is not global YOLO or permission to
invent work. The scope is your personal settings for this project unless you
explicitly choose user-wide sessions, which can affect your other projects.

On an actual **Yes**, the agent backs up the relevant files, adds the existing
native rules without duplicates, and preserves stricter rules and unrelated
settings. It checks bare and actual absolute-path invocations, rule loading and
repeated harmless reads in the target conversation. No or no answer leaves
settings alone and continues with existing prompts. Unsupported scope or a
managed restriction is reported; it is not permission to grant broader access.

The agent remembers an explicit choice, scope and exact additions in existing
onboarding context, so setup does not ask again. You do not need to approve each
routine edit separately. To undo, say **“Undo the OpenRig command allowances
added by this setup; keep my other rules.”** The agent removes only its recorded
additions, preserves earlier rules and later edits, and verifies reloading.
Other pre-existing allowances may still permit commands after this undo.

Use the maintained **Applying a permission policy** procedure:

```sh
rig context get skills/applying-a-permission-policy/SKILL.md
```

In a source checkout, read [its source](../../packages/daemon/assets/plugins/openrig-core/skills/applying-a-permission-policy/SKILL.md).
In an npm installation, the same file is under
`@openrig/cli/daemon/assets/plugins/openrig-core/skills/applying-a-permission-policy/SKILL.md`
below the matching `npm root -g` or local `npm root`. Use the version supplying
your `rig` executable. It covers Codex/Claude command rules, actual config roots,
preserving restrictions and verifying the target conversation. A missing guide or
unsupported native version is a reported gap, not permission to silently bypass.

The broader launch-mode recipes below are optional. Command-family rules do not
require changing the starter's sandbox or everyone else's defaults.

## Opt-in permissive operation

Permissive operation lets agents act with your account's filesystem and network
access with fewer permission stops. They can damage files or send data without
another confirmation. Use it only for work and an environment you deliberately
trust; it does not supply missing credentials or override organization policy.

Make changes in a **user-owned spec before its first launch**. To customize the
starter, run `rig specs show starter --kind rig` and find its `Path`, ending
in `specs/rigs/launch/starter/rig.yaml`. Copy that whole `specs` directory to
`./openrig-specs` in your repository, keeping its layout: copying only `rig.yaml`
breaks its relative agent and culture references. Leave the installed copy alone.
The examples below use `./openrig-specs/rigs/launch/starter/rig.yaml`. If you
already have a running `starter`, follow the existing-session advice below
before changing it; this is not a live permission switch.

### Codex: select sandbox and approvals together

For Codex versions supporting named `.config.toml` profiles, create
`~/.codex/starter-permissive.config.toml` (under `CODEX_HOME` instead if you
set it for the daemon's launch environment):

```toml
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
approval_policy = "never"
```

In the copied rig, add this field to **each Codex member** that should use it (in
starter, that's `dev.review`); keep the member's existing `profile: default`:

```yaml
codex_config_profile: starter-permissive
```

Leave `permission_policy` absent or set it to `none`, with no member-level YOLO
override. OpenRig then passes `-p starter-permissive` instead of its default
`-s workspace-write`, so the native profile supplies both settings. Higher-priority
native project configuration or managed requirements can still change/refuse the
result. Inspect native `/status` before assigning work.

```sh
rig policy current --spec ./openrig-specs/rigs/launch/starter/rig.yaml
rig up ./openrig-specs/rigs/launch/starter/rig.yaml --cwd . --plan
rig up ./openrig-specs/rigs/launch/starter/rig.yaml --cwd .
```

OpenRig's `permission_policy: builtin:yolo` setting selects
`-s danger-full-access -a never` on fresh, resume and fork launches, replacing
the named-profile argument. The profile recipe above remains useful when you
want to maintain those choices in native configuration. The legacy
environment-only `OPENRIG_YOLO=1` path remains sandbox-only when no resolved
policy is present. A standalone `codex --yolo` command is not an OpenRig setting.
At full access, Codex can show its full-access and GPT-5.1 migration notices at
first launch. When OpenRig itself selects full bypass for the seat (`builtin:yolo`,
or an explicit seat `full_bypass`), `rig up <spec> --non-interruptive` hides them
with per-launch `-c` overrides (see [non-interruptive mode](non-interruptive-mode.md)).
Full access chosen inside a native Codex profile, with `permission_policy` absent or
`none`, doesn't qualify.

To return to a restricted next launch, change the selected profile to:

```toml
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
approval_policy = "on-request"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = false
```

### Per-seat permission mode

Permission mode is the native execution choice; work posture is project guidance.
For an existing managed seat, select future-launch permissions explicitly:

```sh
rig seat set-permissions dev-build@starter --mode full_bypass --reason "Operator selected broader access"
rig seat status dev-build@starter --json
```

This records the actor, reason and old/new choice on that seat. It does not
relaunch it, alter native history, change sibling seats, or edit permission
rules/hooks. A later lifecycle action remains a separate decision. The explicit
seat choice overrides the inherited member/rig policy; `--mode inherit` clears
it without changing that inherited policy. `floor` selects the existing normal
launch path (including a Codex named profile when configured); it does not
rewrite a native profile or force its approval settings.

Codex and Claude accept `floor` and `full_bypass`. Additional Claude native modes,
including `auto`, require support advertised by the managed executable's help.
OpenRig resolves the first executable on its managed launch PATH at the seat's
absolute working directory, then uses that exact path for discovery and launch.
It does not use interactive shell aliases or a shell's modified PATH. Relative
PATH entries and a relative `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` resolve from the seat directory.

For these explicit native modes, fresh, resume, fork and legacy restore use the
same managed environment: PATH, HOME, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (default HOME/.claude)
and the configured classic-renderer setting. Other shell customizations are
excluded. The existing managed identity and allowlisted provider-auth channel
is retained by variable name; credentials are not copied into launch commands
or capability evidence. Help runs without that credential channel. Existing
login files remain under the managed home. Configure the daemon's managed
launch environment deliberately before selecting a mode; this is not a probe
of an arbitrary interactive shell.

Each selection and each later launch checks support again, without a cache.
A changed node/occupant, binding, cwd, executable or capability environment
refuses at the next check: after help, before selection/audit mutation, and
immediately before paste and Enter. A failure after a valid paste is partial
input, not a successful launch or a claim that earlier input was rolled back.
An existing explicit selection is retained on refusal; no fallback is chosen.
Ordinary and inherited launch paths are unchanged. The status response
distinguishes desired settings, generation-bound
launch arguments and an unverified native effect. Inspect the native session
after an authorized launch before claiming its actual permission behavior.

The rig-level verbs are `rig policy permissions list`, `show`, `current` and
`apply`. Existing `rig policy list/show/current/apply` remain compatibility
aliases with the same JSON and exit behavior. Pi resource trust and the per-seat
typing guard are separate controls.

### Claude Code: a different launch flag

In the shipped `starter`, `dev-build` runs Claude Code. For a **Claude Code** seat,
OpenRig normally passes `--permission-mode acceptEdits`: edits can proceed, while
other actions follow native rules and prompts. It does not add a global
`Bash(rig:*)` allowance. To explicitly select the bypass launch flag for that rig:

```sh
rig policy apply yolo --spec ./my-claude-rig/rig.yaml
rig policy current --spec ./my-claude-rig/rig.yaml
```

This records `permission_policy: builtin:yolo`; the next managed launch passes
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Member-level policies take precedence.

On a machine where nobody has accepted it yet, Claude Code then shows its
bypass-permissions warning in each new seat, and OpenRig reports the seat as
needing attention without sending its startup context. Either accept the warning
once beforehand (run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in your repository,
accept, then `/exit`; Claude Code remembers it), or accept it in the seat and run
`rig seat continue <seat>`. Or launch with `rig up <spec> --non-interruptive`,
which accepts it with a launch flag and writes nothing to your settings; see
[non-interruptive mode](non-interruptive-mode.md).

`rig policy apply auto --spec ./my-claude-rig/rig.yaml` (also `rig setup --policy
auto`) records `builtin:auto` instead: Claude seats launch with
`--permission-mode auto`, and Codex and Pi seats, which have no auto mode, launch
at the floor. To return
future launches to OpenRig's `acceptEdits` mode, use `rig policy apply none --spec
./my-claude-rig/rig.yaml` and remove any member-level bypass override. Native rules
and managed restrictions still matter; this flag is not a promise about sandbox
or account access. See [Claude permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions).

**Already running:** changing a file or running `rig policy apply` does not revoke
a live agent's permissions, nor rewrite a stored rig's policy on restore. Pause
work and use the native permission controls for that conversation (current
Codex and Claude CLIs expose `/permissions`); inspect the effective mode again.
Keep the launch spec/profile consistent for subsequent launches. If the native
version cannot apply the change in place, preserve the work and use the supported
same-seat stop/resume path after checking its retained policy; do not erase the
rig or start a duplicate to reset permissions. A resume can reapply the stored
launch mode, so verify the native mode again before continuing work.

## Custom settings and precedence

- **OpenRig:** member `permission_policy` overrides rig `permission_policy`.
  Normal managed launches bind the default mode explicitly when neither is set;
  exporting `OPENRIG_YOLO=1` in a client shell is not a reliable per-team recipe.
  A custom policy file is relative to the declaring rig spec, with no absolute
  path or `..`. `surface: flag` selects a launch mode. Config-surface policies
  (`locked`, `standard`, `open`, or custom) describe intent: recording one does
  not translate and enforce its rules. Apply and inspect the actual native
  settings separately. See [RigSpec policy references](rig-spec.md#attaching-a-permission-policy).
- **Codex:** personal settings live in `~/.codex/config.toml` or `CODEX_HOME`;
  trusted project settings live in `.codex/config.toml`. Current precedence is
  CLI overrides, trusted project settings, selected profile, user settings,
  cloud defaults when supplied, `/etc/codex/config.toml` on Unix, then built-in
  defaults, subject to managed requirements. OpenRig's explicit sandbox flag
  wins over a file's `sandbox_mode`; use `codex_config_profile` for a custom
  sandbox instead. For workspace edits with network access while retaining
  approvals, use a named profile with `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`,
  `approval_policy = "on-request"` and `[sandbox_workspace_write]`
  `network_access = true`. That grants network access generally, not just to
  the local daemon. See [Codex configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-basic)
  and [sandbox/approval controls](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security).
- **Claude Code:** use `~/.claude/settings.json`, shared project
  `.claude/settings.json`, or personal project `.claude/settings.local.json`.
  Managed settings precede launch flags, then project-local, project-shared and
  user settings. Permission-rule lists combine; a higher-level allow is not a
  way to defeat a deny. OpenRig's `acceptEdits` launch flag overrides a file's
  `permissions.defaultMode`; selected runtime resources may also merge into
  project-local settings. See [Claude settings and precedence](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)
  and [OpenRig's runtime config disclosure](agent-startup-guide.md#runtime-config-disclosure).

These recipes do not establish every provider/version/config combination.
Check the installed version and effective settings. Newer permission-profile or
automatic review features are provider choices, not implicit OpenRig capabilities.
Selecting rules or a broader mode does not change the shipped defaults.
