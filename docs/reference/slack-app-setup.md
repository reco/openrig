OpenRig's Slack connector talks to a Slack app that you create in your own workspace. OpenRig
ships the app's manifest; it does not host an app, run an install endpoint, or publish anything
to the Slack Marketplace. The app is a Socket Mode app, so it lives in the one workspace you
create it in.

`rig slack manifest` prints the manifest. It works offline, before any daemon or token exists:

```bash
rig slack manifest          # the manifest as YAML
rig slack manifest --url    # Slack's create-app link with the manifest prefilled
rig slack manifest --json   # the manifest, its scopes and events, and why each scope is requested
```

The TUI shows the same link on the Connections page while Slack is not configured. Neither the
CLI nor the TUI opens a browser, accepts tokens, or creates an app.

## Steps

These are the expected steps, based on Slack's app-manifest documentation. They have not yet
been confirmed against a real creation run. Slack's form may ask for something the prefill did
not fill in; if so, follow the form.

1. Open the link from `rig slack manifest --url` in a browser.
2. Sign in to Slack if asked, pick the workspace, review the prefilled manifest, and click
   **Create**.
3. Under **Socket Mode**, confirm it is enabled. Enable it if it is not.
4. Under **Basic Information → App-Level Tokens**, generate a token with the
   `connections:write` scope and copy it (it starts with `xapp-`).
5. Install the app to the workspace and approve the requested scopes.
6. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (it starts with `xoxb-`).
7. Put both tokens in a private env file readable only by you (`chmod 600`):

   ```bash
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
   ```

8. Invite the bot to the channel you will use (`/invite @OpenRig` in that channel).
   `rig slack verify` reports NOT ready until the app is a member.
9. Register yourself as the human the connector delivers to, with a Slack binding that names
   your Slack user ID (`rig gateway human add`; its `--help` shows the binding format).
   Messages from Slack users who are not registered are not delivered. `rig slack enable`
   needs a readable human registry: on a fresh install with no registry, or with an invalid
   one, it is refused.
10. Run `rig slack setup --channel <channel-id> --secrets-env-file <path>`, then
    `rig slack verify`, then `rig slack enable`.

## What the app asks for

Run `rig slack manifest --json` for the exact list and the reason for each scope. There are two
groups:

- **Baseline scopes**: posting messages, reading message history in public channels the app is
  a member of, and reading channel details.
  `rig slack verify` checks these.
- **Feature scopes**: `files:read` (download attachments people send), `files:write` (upload
  attachments to Slack), `app_mentions:read` (receive @-mentions of the app), `reactions:read`
  (receive a ✅ that answers a decision), and `groups:history` / `groups:read` (use a private
  channel: its messages, history and membership check). `rig slack verify` warns when one of these is missing (if
  Slack returns the granted scopes) but does not require them, so a READY from verify does not
  prove attachments, mentions, reactions or a private channel will work.

If a feature scope was not granted, the effect differs by feature:

- **Attachments** (`files:read`, `files:write`): the file download or upload call fails. A
  message with an attachment that could not be downloaded is still delivered, with the failed
  file named in it. A post whose attachment could not be uploaded still delivers its text, and
  the failure appears only in the daemon log (`rig daemon logs`).
- **Mentions** (`app_mentions:read`): Slack does not deliver `app_mention` events to the app.
  Only `rig slack verify` warns that the scope is missing; nothing reports the missing events.
- **Reactions** (`reactions:read`): Slack does not deliver `reaction_added` events, so a ✅ answers
  nothing. Use a button or an `answer:` reply instead.
- **Private channel** (`groups:history`, `groups:read`): Slack delivers no messages from a private
  channel, history recovery fails there, and `rig slack verify` cannot confirm the app is a member.
  A public channel needs neither scope.

So after installing, compare the granted scopes Slack shows for the app with all nine scopes that
`rig slack manifest --json` lists.

The app subscribes to messages in public and private channels it is a member of
(`message.channels`, `message.groups`), to mentions of the app (`app_mention`), and to reactions
(`reaction_added`). It does not request direct-message access. For a private channel, invite the
app to it (`/invite @<app name>`); Slack does not let an app join a private channel by itself.

The manifest also turns on **Interactivity**, so the human can answer a decision's structured
questions by clicking a button (`rig queue create --human-questions-file`). In Socket Mode the
clicks arrive over the same socket, so no request URL is needed. An app created from an older
manifest has Interactivity off: turn it on under **Interactivity & Shortcuts**, or the buttons
will do nothing.

How a decision is answered depends on `explicitAnswersOnly` in `slack-connector.json`:

- **On (this build's default):** a typed reply in the decision's thread is conversation. It goes
  to the asking seat, which can answer in the same thread (`rig queue create --human-intent update
  --reply-to <decision>`), and it resolves nothing. Every decision shows buttons: the seat's
  action (or "Confirm"), or option buttons; typing is always possible and reaches the seat. An acknowledgement request
  (`--human-intent ack`) has no buttons and resolves on the asked human's ✅. 👍 and 👎 on any
  bot message are recorded as feedback and never decide. The decision resolves on a button click
  (including an approve button carrying the seat's call to action, `--confirm "Build it"` on the
  decision), a reply starting with `answer:`, a Confirm click on the seat's stated reading
  (`--confirm <reading>` on an update replying to the decision), or a ✅ from the asked human on
  an acknowledgement request's root (answered as "acknowledged"), on their own reply in the thread (that reply's text), or on a Confirm
  offer. It resolves once; later answers reach the seat as messages.
  Answering does not close the request: its thread stays open until the outcome the seat linked
  (`rig queue update --link pr:<url>|issue:<url>|qitem:<id>`) is finished, or the asked human
  replies `cancel`. After `staleReminderDays` (default 3) without activity, an unanswered request
  reminds its human in the thread and an answered one reminds its seat. Reminders close nothing.
- **Off:** any typed reply in the thread answers the decision.

## What the connector does with the tokens

The tokens stay in the env file you created. The connector reads them from that file and uses them
to authenticate to Slack: it opens an outbound Socket Mode connection with the app-level token and
calls Slack's Web API with the bot token. This connector has no OpenRig-hosted component and
makes outbound connections only. That statement is about this Slack connector, not about every
part of OpenRig.

## Next

- `rig slack status` shows what is still missing, without contacting Slack.
- `rig slack verify` checks the granted baseline scopes and channel membership with Slack.

## Reconnect recovery and status

The daemon scans available top-level messages in the configured channel after a
Socket Mode connection and on its existing five-minute retry cadence. Recovered
queue rows say **Recovered after a gap** and show the original Slack posting time.
They use the same sender admission, routing, attachment handling, fixed identity
and dead-letter path as live messages. A durable dead letter is custody of a
failed delivery, not successful delivery.

Recovery keeps a per-channel checkpoint across reconnects, restarts and channel
switches. On upgrade it initializes once from the newest retained accepted
channel landing; without such evidence it starts at feature adoption. **Older
history is unknown.** New live messages never move the recovery checkpoint. A
partial scan resumes its saved interval; only an exhausted interval advances the
covered boundary. Each new interval ends five seconds before the local clock to
allow recent messages to become visible; larger clock skew or visibility lag is
not covered by that margin. A corrupt or unreadable checkpoint leaves recovery unavailable
and preserves the existing file; live inbound continues.

Each pass admits at most four pages, 100 entries and 15 seconds of work, with a
five-second history-request ceiling. An already admitted attachment/landing keeps
its owner until it settles. Rate limits retain Slack's Retry-After across restart.
Transport and server failures use a five-second backoff unless Slack supplies Retry-After.
When Slack reports a plan history limit, recovery still lands the available page
and advances normally, retaining an older-history limitation in status across restarts.
Missing bot credentials, history scope, membership, retention limits and API
failures appear as recovery limitations. No additional scope is required to keep
live delivery working. Thread-reply catch-up and dead-connection detection remain
outside this recovery scope; global chronological order is not promised.

`rig slack status` retains local configuration checks and adds a bounded daemon
snapshot: socket state/generation, last event, recovery interval/state/reason,
retry time and accepted/dead-lettered recovery counts since the connector last
started (they reset when it is enabled or disabled, and when the daemon restarts).
Human-readable coverage and pending bounds use ISO timestamps; JSON keeps Slack timestamps.
The status read calls no Slack API and starts no scan. If the daemon cannot be
observed, local configuration remains visible and live state is unknown. A
connected socket or valid configuration alone does not prove end-to-end delivery.
