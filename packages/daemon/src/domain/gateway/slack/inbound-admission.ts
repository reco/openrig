// M1 A6 v3 — wire the inbound registration gate to the daemon human-registry. Kept as a pure
// factory (the registry surface is injected) so it is unit-testable without the daemon and the
// actual daemon import stays LAZY at the call site (dep rail). Maps a registry lookup to the
// InboundRouter's InboundSenderResolution:
//   - registry load FAILS   -> REFUSE, fail-CLOSED, surfacing reg.error (r1 A4b follow-on: a
//                              broken registry is distinct from an absent entity; never fabricate
//                              a human seat because we could not check).
//   - sender REGISTERED     -> admit; source = the registered human's @external address.
//   - sender UNREGISTERED   -> REFUSE with the resolver's LOUD teaching.

import type { InboundSenderResolution } from "./inbound.js";
// S10 re-home: this module now lives IN the daemon, so the registry surface types resolve
// relatively (the lazy-import dep rail was a CLI concern; the injectable surface stays for tests).
